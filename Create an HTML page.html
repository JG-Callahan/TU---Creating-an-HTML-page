	<h1>HTML</h1>
		<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. 
		<br>
		HTML describes the structure of a web page.
		<br>
		HTML has tree structure consisting of branches and nodes.
		</p>
	<h2>HTML elements</h2>
		<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
		<br>
		An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags".
	</p>
	<h2>HTML tags</h2>
		<p>Tags consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">".
		<br>
		HTML5, the current standard for HTML, has roughly 100 tags.
		</P>
	<h2>web browsers</h2>
		<p>Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
			<ul>
				<li>text</li>
				<li>media</li>
				<li>interaction</li>
				<li>markup</li>
				<li>classes</li>
			</ul>
		Many browsers have default styles for the appearance of the document based on the meaning of the tag.
